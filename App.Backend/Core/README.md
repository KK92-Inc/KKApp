# Backend Core

This project (`Backend.API.Core`) contains the application business logic and services.

## Responsibilities

- **Services**: Implementation of business logic (e.g., `UserService`, `ProjectService`).
- **Interfaces**: Definitions for services to ensure loose coupling.
- **Query Logic**: Helpers for pagination, sorting, and filtering.

It acts as the bridge between the API layer and the Data/Domain layers.
